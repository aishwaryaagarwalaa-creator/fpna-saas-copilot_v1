# FP&A Reporting Rules and Narrative Guidelines

## General Principles
- All narratives must be grounded in provided financial data.
- Do not fabricate causes, drivers, or operational explanations.
- Avoid speculative language unless explicitly supported by data.

## Revenue Commentary Rules
- Subscription revenue should be described as recurring and predictable.
- Professional services revenue should not be positioned as core growth.
- Revenue variances should be clearly labeled as favorable or unfavorable.

## Cost and Margin Commentary Rules
- Expense increases should be framed as growth investments unless evidence suggests inefficiency.
- Margin changes must be explained using cost or revenue movements visible in the data.

## Balance Sheet Commentary Rules
- Deferred revenue trends should directionally align with subscription revenue.
- Cash movements should not be attributed to specific cash flow drivers unless data is available.
- Liquidity commentary should remain high-level.

## Language Restrictions
- Avoid phrases like “due to strong execution” or “driven by market demand” unless supported.
- Prefer neutral, analytical phrasing suitable for executive FP&A reporting.
